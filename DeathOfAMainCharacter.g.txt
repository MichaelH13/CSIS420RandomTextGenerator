<final_ending>	
Unfortunately, the trouble didn't stop there. Soon, <disaster> and <disaster> . They died shortly after. \n ;
100 deaths and resurrections later, they finally died. For realsies. <main_character> mourned profusely. \n ;
After the trauma of such a disaster, they regenerated. \n ;
They quickly recovered and went about life as normal. The next disaster would occur two days later. \n ;
Two years later, they reappeared to their friends after letting them believe they had been dead. Their friends had mixed reactions, from screaming in terror, to shocked disbelief, to straight-out punching their lights out. \n ;
Oddly enough, they stayed dead. It was very out of character. \n ;
Thanks to <main_character> , they survived the disaster, and lived to die another day. \n ;
